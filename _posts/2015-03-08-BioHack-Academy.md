title: "BioHack Academy: BioFactory - Waag Society"
---

Few weeks ago I have enrolled for [BioHack Academy](http://www.waag.org/biohackacademy) at [Waag Society Amsterdam](http://waag.org).
Already completed few Coursera courses related to biology and genetics in general and now it is time to do some practical things.
In the following weeks I expect to build Open Source hardware for my own biofactory and start growing biomaterials.
Hardware projects will have dedicated pages describing the whole process how to build any of them.
