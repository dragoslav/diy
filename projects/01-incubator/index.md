[In biology, an incubator is a device used to grow and maintain microbiological cultures or cell cultures.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubator_%28culture%29)
Design of the following incubator is based on one from [Biohack Academy](http://biohackacademy.github.io/biofactory/class/1-incubator/).

Main differences:

* Instead of Arduino microcontroller, it will be controlled by Raspberry Pi 2.
* It should have a smaller volume. In order to achieve that it will be used different heat source (heating foil) and no fan.

## Design

In order find the most suitable design several hypotheses ere tested and these are some results.

1. just a plain carton box
2. 2cm think insulation (EPS) without gluing it (led to some warm air leakage)
3. no fan - checking distribution of the warm air by 2 temperature sensors (bottom & top) 
4. heating foil connected to 5V - using the same [power source](https://www.conrad.nl/nl/inbouwnetvoeding-5-vdc-5-a-25-w-tdk-lambda-ls-25-5-512731.html) as for Raspberry Pi

[Wiring]({{ site.url }}/projects/01-incubator/incubator.fzz), note that temperature sensors are DS18S20 and heating element is the heating foil not a Peltier element.

Software to run the incubator can be found [here](https://github.com/dragoslav/incubator).

Conclusion after this experimental design:

1. Heat distribution is not uniform as it could be expected.

![temperature profile]({{ site.url }}/projects/01-incubator/temperature-profile.png)

2. Heating foil with 5V power supply is not good enough. Alone it can reach around 35°C but within container temperature stays below 30°C. 
   Next try out should be with 12V - maximum voltage per specification.
   
3. 4cm thick EPS instead of 2cm.


### Incubator casing

For incubator box (casing) the following Magic Box [template]({{ site.url }}/projects/01-incubator/magic_box_template.mbt) is used.
It is a modified version of [Press-fit Box](http://magic-box.org/c/designs/). The main difference is that one side can be configured differently: number of steps (t_steps) and fitting (tpf). 
That allows 5 sides to strongly fit together and the remaining (top) side just to be used as a cover.
SVG files can be generated using the template and online Magic Box [tool](http://magic-box.org/tool/).
