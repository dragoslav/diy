This is a simple experiment to test an [incubator]({{ site.url }}/projects/01-incubator) and get some knowledge about contamination tests and UV influence on microorganisms.

## Setup

* Petri dish with [nutrient agar](http://biohackacademy.github.io/biofactory/annex/cultivation-media/nutrient-agar/):
  * [Marmite](http://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi206448/marmite-yeast-extract) yeast extract
  * Dried milk as substitute for peptone
* Microorganism from the soil - peace of soil diluted in water, filtered through porous paper and liquid dispersed on the agar
* [UV LED](https://www.conrad.nl/nl/5004pch02-uv-emitter-405-nm-5-mm-radiaal-bedraad-160000.html) attached on the upper part of incubator (shining down directly on the Petri dish)
* Incubator setup to provide 26Â°C
* Petri dish cover has 4 areas: 
  1. aluminium cover
  2. sunscreen
  3. ordinary hand cream
  4. plain cover
